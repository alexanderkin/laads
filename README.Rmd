laads
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/masalmon/laads.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/masalmon/laads)
[![codecov.io](https://codecov.io/github/masalmon/laads/coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/github/masalmon/laads?branch=master)

laads is under development (and not really usable yet) and will provide an interface to the [NASA API of MODIS Level 1 and Atmosphere data products](https://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/data/api.html).

```{r}
library("laads")

```

The functions of the package mimick the API methods. The documentation is often a copy of the parameters or API methods documentation. Further below a few workflow examples are given in order to help navigating the different functions.

# A bit of information about the API

## What data is accessible via the LAADS API

From the [FAQ](http://modaps.nascom.nasa.gov/services/faq/), "LAADS is being populated with large volumes of MODIS data from the NASA EOS Terra and Aqua spacecrafts as they are produced. These data include Collection 5 and some earlier data from Collection 3 & 4 such as Aqua/Terra Atmosphere Level 2 & 3 products. New Collection 6 MODIS Aqua Level 1 and Level 2 Atmosphere products are available while all Terra and rest of Aqua products will be included soon. LAADS also provide access to MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS) data (via FTP only; not searchable), NPP VIIRS Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 products, and ENVISAT MERIS Level 1B Full Resolution (FR) and Reduced Resolution (RR) data sets from European Space Agency (ESA)."

If this does not include the data you are looking for, have a look at [the MODISTools package](https://github.com/seantuck12/MODISTools) that supports retrieving and using MODIS data subsets using ORNL DAAC web service (SOAP) for subsetting from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).

## How to cite the data when using it

For knowing how to cite the data when using it, please see [this document](http://modaps.nascom.nasa.gov/services/faq/LAADS_Data-Use_Citation_Policies.pdf).

# Workflow example

## Getting files for the product MYD04_3K near Hyderabad

Context: say we want to get the product MYD04_3K for a rectangle 17 N to 18 N latitude, 78 E to 79 E longitude
